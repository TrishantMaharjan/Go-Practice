How you make me feel in one word?
Acasă
Loosely translated to "At Home", acasă is a
Romanian word that describes a deep sense of
belonging, beyond just a physical place.
It's a place where you feel comfortable. A place
where you feel safe. A place where you feel loved.
For some, it's the house where they grew up. For
others, it's a favorite song or a memory. But for me?
It's wherever you are.
